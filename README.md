# TASK-3-ME
Forward and Inverse Kinematics 3 degree of freedom
in this task, we need to calculate forward and Inverse Kinematics for 3 degrees of freedom first we will talk about the difference between the 2

Forward Kinematics is the process in which we calculate the end factor position based on the angle of the joints(in our case, the motor) by giving the joint angles we can 
find the (x,y,z) position of the arm
 
Inverse Kinematics as the name implies is the opposite of forward Kinematics in which we calculate the joint angle based on the end factor and where we want the arm to go, also it's more complex than the
Forward Kinematics.

Forward and Inverse Kinematics are used in many fields such as robotics, graphics, and game design 
the file named(ME Forward Kinematics Inverse Kinematics) contains the givine task solution
